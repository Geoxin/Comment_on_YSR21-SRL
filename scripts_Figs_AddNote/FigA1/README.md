### Residuals (dt(res)) based on the correction YSR23-errata and no effect of the instrument responses used between YSR21 and this comment. 
1. dt(res) computed based on corrected relocation results in the correction YSR23-erratra.
   - Align-YSR23errata.D1/D2: List of dt(pre), dt(res) for P waves at global stations of the doublet D1/D2.
   - Following the plotting style of Figs. 1 &3 in this comment.
2. Waveform alignment at OBN of data processed with instrument responses used in YSR21 and this comment.
   - Data processed with instrument responses in two studies:
     - YSR21: II.OBN.00.BHZ.M.xxxx.xxx.xxxxxx.SAC.bp.ysr21
       - Data: same as those used in this comment in [file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UTYFrVcsD4f5Gl1H8fE8Cw8pLZmHhQFF?usp=drive_link)
       - Instrument response: accessed in the [reply](https://github.com/yiyanguiuc/Data-used-in-Reply-to-Zhang-and-Wen). Also see [a duplication of the authors' archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wNkmC2OmnrXnHrW1BGAVshxsK_vXWoDM/view?usp=drive_link).
       - _NOTE: YSR21 instrument response of OBN is the same the version used in this comment, and is also identical with the version one could access at present on [IRIS-MDA-OBN](https://ds.iris.edu/mda/II/OBN/).
