Reproducibility test of the "clock errors" reported in YSR21 (Table S2 therein)
---
- List_dtAlign_all
  - [number of "problematic" stations reported in YSR21-TableS2] | doublet name in YSR21-TableS2
  - station name | phase (of minimal difference from YSR21 reported "clock error") | epicentral distance (°) | difference of dt predition (YSR21-this) | difference of dt residual (YSR21-this)
- List_eventpairs:
  - doublet ID | doublet name in YSR21-TableS2 | [number of "problematic" stations reported in YSR21-TableS2]
 
      
- NOTE: _YSR21 stated that YSR21’s reported “clock errors” were calculated with respect to “the first mantle P arrivals if the distance is smaller than 104°, or the inner-core PKP arrivals if between 104° and 145°, or the outer-core PKP arrivals if greater than 145°”. The exact phase of use for each station was not stated in YSR21. Therefore, we here compute the clock error of a station with respect to all possible phases of firstly-arrived P, Pn, Pdiff, PKPab, PKPbc, PKiKP, PKPdf, and choose the calculated clock error that has the minimal difference from YSR21’s reported “clock error” in the reproducibility test._
